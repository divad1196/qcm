Option D is incorrect because IAM users are not directly mapped to employees' corporate identities. For more information on Direct Connect, please refer to below URL: ' https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/ From the AWS Documentation, for federated access, you also need to ensure the right policy permissions are in place Configure permissions in AWS for your federated users The next step is to create an IAM role that establishes a trust relationship between IAM and your organization's IdP that identifies your IdP as a principal (trusted entity) for purposes of federation. The role also defines what users authenticated your organization's IdP are allowed to do in AWS. You can use the IAM console to create this role. When you create the trust policy that indicates who can assume the role, you specify the SAML provider that you created earlier in IAM along with one or more SAML attributes that a user must match to be allowed to assume the role. For example, you can specify that only users whose SAML eduPersonOrgDN value is ExampleOrg are allowed to sign in. The role wizard automatically adds a condition to test the saml:aud attribute to make sure that the role is assumed only for sign-in to the AWS Management Console.

Choose 2 answers from the options given below","choices":{"A":"Enable versioning on the S3 bucket","B":"Enable data at rest for the objects in the bucket","C":"Enable MFA Delete in the bucket policy","D":"Enable data in transit for the objects in the bucket"},"answer":"AC","explanation":"One of the AWS Security blogs mentions the followinj Versioning keeps multiple versions of an object in the same bucket. When you enable it on a bucket Amazon S3 automatically adds a unique version ID to every object stored in the bucket. At that point, a simple DELETE action does not permanently delete an object version; it merely associates a delete marker with the object. If you want to permanently delete an object version, you must specify its version ID in your DELETE request. You can add another layer of protection by enabling MFA Delete on a versioned bucket. Once you do so, you must provide your AWS accounts access keys and a valid code from the account's MFA device in order to permanently delete an object version or suspend or reactivate versioning on the bucket. Option B is invalid because enabling encryption does not guarantee risk of data deletion. Option D is invalid because this option does not guarantee risk of data deletion.

However, Amazon EBS replication is stored within the same availability zone, not across multiple zones; therefore, it is highly recommended that you conduct regular snapshots to Amazon S3 for long-term data durability. You can use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (Amazon DLM) to automate the creation, retention, and deletion of snapshots taken to back up your Amazon EBS volumes. With lifecycle management, you can be sure that snapshots are cleaned up regularly and keep costs under control. EBS Lifecycle Policies A lifecycle policy consists of these core settings: • Resource type—The AWS resource managed by the policy, in this case, EBS volumes. • Target tag—The tag that must be associated with an EBS volume for it to be managed by the policy. • Schedule—Defines how often to create snapshots and the maximum number of snapshots to keep. Snapshot creation starts within an hour of the specified start time. If creating a new snapshot exceeds the maximum number of snapshots to keep for the volume, the oldest snapshot is deleted.

You can use a custom customer master key (CMK) by choosing one from the list that appears below the encryption box. If you do not specify a custom CMK, Amazon EBS uses the AWS- managed CMK for Amazon EBS in your account. If there is no AWS-managed CMK for Amazon EBS in your account, Amazon EBS creates one. Data protection refers to protecting data while in-transit (as it travels to and from Amazon S3) and at rest (while it is stored on disks in Amazon S3 data centers). You can protect data in transit by using SSL or by using client-side encryption. You have the following options of protecting data at rest in Amazon S3. • Use Server-Side Encryption - You request Amazon S3 to encrypt your object before saving it on disks in its data centers and decrypt it when you download the objects. • Use Client-Side Encryption - You can encrypt data client-side and upload the encrypted data to Amazon S3. In this case, you manage the encryption process, the encryption keys, and related tools. Option A is invalid because using EBS-optimized Amazon EC2 instances alone will not guarantee protection of instances at rest. Option C is invalid because this will not encrypt data at rest for S3 objects. Option D is invalid because you don't store data in Instance store.

It is not available for CMKs that have imported key material (the value of the Origin field is External), but you can rotate these CMKs manually. Rotating Keys Manually You might want to create a newCMKand use it in place of a current CMK instead of enabling automatic key rotation. When the new CMK has different cryptographic material than the current CMK, using the new CMK has the same effect as changing the backing key in an existing CMK. The process of replacing one CMK with another is known as manual key rotation. When you begin using the new CMK, be sure to keep the original CMK enabled so that AWS KMS can decrypt data that the original CMK encrypted. When decrypting data, KMS identifies the CMK that was used to encrypt the data, and it uses the sam CMK to decrypt the dat A. As long as you keep both the original and new CMKs enabled, AWS KMS can decrypt any data that was encrypted by either CMK. Option B is invalid because you also need to point the key alias to the new key Option C is invalid because existing CMK keys cannot be rotated as they are Option E is invalid because deleting existing keys will not guarantee the creation of a new default CMK key For more information on Key rotation please see the below Link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developereuide/rotate-keys.html The correct answers are: Enable automatic key rotation for a CMK, Import new key material to a new CMK; Point the key alias to the new CMK."},{"question":"A new application will be deployed on EC2 instances in private subnets.
